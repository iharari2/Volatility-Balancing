# UI/UX & Component Guidelines

1. **Design System Adherence:** NEVER hardcode colors or spacing. ALWAYS use Tailwind classes or CSS variables defined in `@theme.css`.
2. **Visual Continuity:** Before changing a shared component (e.g., `Button.tsx`), check all instances of its usage across the codebase using `@codebase`.
3. **Component Structure:** - Use Functional Components with TypeScript interfaces for Props.
   - Keep logic (hooks) at the top, followed by sub-components, then the main render.
4. **No "Magic" Layouts:** Use Flexbox or Grid exclusively. Avoid `position: absolute` unless explicitly required for overlays.
5. **Mobile First:** Ensure every UI change includes responsive classes (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) and verify it doesn't break on small screens.
